<p>
Our practice is committed to providing you and your family with safe, gentle, high-quality dental care. We understand that you, or your child, may feel anxious about visiting the dentist. We are sensitive to your needs, and it is our goal to make you feel comfortable visiting our practice while providing you with the best care possible.</p>
<h2>
Your first visit is all about you &ndash; your comfort, your happiness, and your health.</h2>
<p>
During your first visit, we will review your dental and medical history forms, and take X-rays of your teeth and mouth. Then, the doctor will meet with you to discuss your X-rays, help you create your own individual treatment plan, and answer any questions that you may have. At your next visit, one of our hygienists will clean and polish your teeth, checking your teeth and gums for any cavities or early signs of tooth decay or gingivitis.</p>
<h2>
Bring your smile, but also remember to bring these with you to your first appointment:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Your completed patient information form</li>
<li>
Your insurance card</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Regular checkups are an important part of maintaining a healthy smile!</h2>
<p>
The Canadian Dental Association recommends visiting your dentist every six months for regular checkups and routine teeth cleanings to keep your teeth and gums healthy.</p>
<p>
We understand that you have a busy schedule, so when you&#39;re preparing to visit the dentist, please remember that your appointments can last between 45 and 90 minutes.</p>
