<h2> Restoring Optimum Function and Appearance to Your Smile</h2>
<p>
Prosthodontics, also known as prosthetic dentistry, is one of the nine dental specialties recognized by the Canadian Dental Association (CDA). Prosthodontists are qualified to offer service in state-of-the-art procedures and techniques such as dental implants, bridges, crowns, dentures, fillings, occlusal disease treatment, and TMJ/TMD treatment.</p>
<h2>Our Services</h2>
<h3>Implant Dentistry</h3>
<p> When you&#39;re looking for options to replace missing teeth, we offer many choices depending on your individual needs. Implants are a safe and proven way to replace your missing teeth without involving or compromising any adjacent teeth.</p>
<h3>
Bridges</h3>
<p>
If you&#39;re missing one or more teeth, you may notice a difference in your ability to chew and speak. Bridges are a great option to help restore your smile. </p>
<h3>
Crowns</h3>
<p>
A dental crown is a tooth-shaped &quot;cap&quot; that is placed over the tooth to restore its shape, size, strength, and appearance.</p>
<h3>
Dentures</h3>
<p>
Gum disease, injury, and tooth decay can all cause a loss of your natural teeth. However, we can bring back the smile on your face with dentures to restore your missing teeth. </p>
<h3>
Veneers</h3>
<p>
Veneers are thin, custom-made shells made from tooth-colored materials, such as porcelain, designed to cover the front side of your teeth. Veneers are natural in appearance and a great option for patients who want to make adjustments to the look and feel of their smile.</p>
<h3>
Fillings</h3>
<p>
A filling is often used to repair a tooth that is affected by wear, decay, cracks, or fractures. The decayed or affected portion of the tooth is removed and replaced with a filling, which can be made up of many different materials.</p>
<h3>
Occlusal Disease</h3>
<p>
Occlusal disease is caused by a malocclusion, or improperly aligned bite. Patients with occlusal disease can experience symptoms of excessive tooth wear, sensitivity, muscle pain, and TMJ pain.</p>
<h3>TMJ/TMD</h3>
<p> Thousands of Canadians suffer from chronic facial and neck pain as well as recurring headaches. In some cases, this pain is due to Temporomandibular Disorder, or TMD.</p>
