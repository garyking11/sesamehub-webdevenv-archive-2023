<h2>Better screening saves lives</h2>
<p>According to the Canadian Cancer Society, oral cancer affects more than 3,600 people in Canada each year. Don't let yourself be one of them.
ViziLite&reg; Plus is a simple screening system that was developed to help oral health care professionals identify and evaluate abnormalities in your mouth. These may include suspicious oral lesions, pre-cancerous cells, and cancer that may be difficult to see during a regular visual exam. When oral cancer is found early, treatment is less invasive and outcomes are far better. Early detection of oral cancer can help save your life.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>The ViziLite Plus exam is completely painless and takes only a few minutes. Using a specially formulated mouthwash that makes cell abnormalities more prominent and a low-intensity light source, your dentist or hygienist will be able to see any irregularities in your lips, mouth, tongue, and throat that may have been missed under normal incandescent light.</p>

<p>If a suspicious lesion is detected, your health care professional will mark the area with our non-toxic TBlue&reg; dye and document it in your records. If necessary, you may be asked to return for a follow-up appointment to monitor any changes in the growth, or referred to an oral surgeon for a biopsy. The earlier any abnormality is detected, the sooner you can receive treatment.</p>

<h2>Are you at risk for oral cancer?</h2>

<p>There are several risk factors for oral cancer. Some are preventable, some are not. Keep in mind that 25% of oral cancer patients show no risk factors at all.</p>

<ul>
<li>Any tobacco use, such as cigarettes, cigars, or chewing tobacco</li>
<li>Excessive or heavy drinking</li>
<li>Family history of oral cancer</li>
<li>Infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV)</li>
</ul>

<p>The single most important way to reduce the risk of developing oral cancer is to reduce the risk factors. Stop using tobacco and evaluate your alcohol consumption. If you use tobacco, drink heavily, or are over the age of 40, ask your dentist to evaluate your oral health with a visual exam and the ViziLite Plus oral cancer screening system.</p>
