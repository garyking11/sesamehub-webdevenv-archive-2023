<h2>Specializing in Saving Teeth</h2>
<p>An endodontist is a dentist who has specialized in treating and handling dental problems that involve the nerve tissue and blood vessels located inside the tooth. If the tooth pulp, containing nerves, vessels, lymphatic tissue, and fibrous tissue, becomes diseased or injured, endodontic treatment is required to save the tooth. </p>

<p>After completing four years of dental school, endodontists complete an extra two or more years of specialty postgraduate training through a hospital or university-based program accredited by the Canadian Dental Association (CDA). </p>

<h3>With the lengthy education that an endodontist receives, they are able to perform all aspects of endodontic therapy, including:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Diagnosis and treatment of dental pain</li>
<li>Routine and complex root canals</li>
<li>Retreatments</li>
<li>Endodontic surgery</li>
<li>Treatment of traumatic dental injuries </li>
<li>Treatment of cracked teeth</li>
</ul>

<p>Endodontists use state-of-the-art technology, such as digital imaging, operating microscopes, ultrasonic instrumentation, and fiber optics while performing endodontic treatment. Technology, along with specialized techniques, gives endodontists an accurate view of the tooth and allows them to treat the tooth quickly and comfortably.
</p>

<p>By choosing to receive treatment by an endodontist, you are choosing to keep your natural teeth as a healthy foundation for chewing and biting for years to come. </p>
