<p>Our office is pleased to offer our patients Damon Smile braces. Damon braces use a slide mechanism to hold the archwire, reducing the amount of pressure exerted on the teeth and allowing the teeth to move more freely, quickly, and comfortably.</p>

<h2>Damon Smile Braces – A world without elastic ties!</h2>
<p>Damon braces use a specialized slide in place of elastics to help the wire guide teeth into place. These slides help reduce the amount of pressure being placed on the tooth. As a result, treatment with Damon Smile is often faster and requires fewer adjustments than traditional braces.</p>

<h2>Braces are the beginning, but the system makes the smile!</h2>
<p>Damon Smile takes a different approach to treating patients.</p>
<h2>Technology</h2>
<p>Damon passive self-ligating braces eliminate the need for elastic or metal "ties." With Damon tie-less braces you can experience treatment without tightening.</p>

<h2>Treatment Time</h2>
<p>While the time needed in braces will vary from case to case, treatment time with Damon Smile is typically much faster than with conventional braces. Also, far fewer appointments are required during treatment.</p>

<h2>Comfort</h2>
<p>Even though Damon Smile works so quickly, the use of gentle, low-friction force means less discomfort for you. Very light "shape memory" titanium wires are used, gently guiding your teeth to their ideal position.</p>

<h2>Convenience</h2>
<p>Damon braces are designed to be discreet, comfortable, and easy to keep clean. Plus, Damon Smile is available in clear brackets for patients who don’t want to sacrifice aesthetics.</p>
