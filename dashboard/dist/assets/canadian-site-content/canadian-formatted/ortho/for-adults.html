<p>Orthodontic treatment is no longer just for teens. In fact, the Canadian Association of Orthodontists states that one
    in five orthodontic patients is over the age of 21. Many adults are choosing to receive treatment because they
    understand the importance of maintaining their health, and they want to feel better about their appearance. Adults
    everywhere are taking advantage of the opportunity to receive orthodontic care, and now you can too.</p>

<p>Common reasons why adults are considering orthodontic treatment:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A bad bite or malocclusion, causing teeth to fit together incorrectly</li>
    <li>Teeth are crowded or spaced apart, possibly leading to tooth decay or gum disease</li>
    <li>Abnormal jaw pain or pressure that is caused by crooked teeth</li>
    <li>Desire for a healthier mouth and a more confident smile</li>
</ul>

<h2>Treatment Options for Adults</h2>

<p>For many adults, the thought of having metal braces is enough to discourage them from receiving treatment. However,
    today's orthodontic treatment options offer a variety of braces and appliances that are comfortable, aesthetic, and
    customized to meet your needs. Types of braces include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Clear braces</li>
    <li>Ceramic braces</li>
    <li>Self-ligating braces</li>
    <li>Lingual (behind the tooth) braces</li>
    <li>Invisible braces</li>
    <li>Traditional metal braces</li>
</ul>

<p>The difference between adult orthodontics and orthodontics for children and teens:</p>

<p>The main difference between treating adults and children or teens is that the jawbones of younger patients are still
    developing. For adults, these bones have stopped growing, which may make orthognathic surgery possible to align the
    jawbones. Other differences include:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Gum or bone loss (periodontal disease):</strong> Adults are more likely than children to experience gum recession or even
        bone loss due to gingivitis or advanced periodontal disease. Patients with straighter teeth are less likely to
        get gum disease.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Worn or missing teeth:</strong> Over time teeth can become worn down and shift into different positions that can only be
        corrected with orthodontic care. Missing teeth can cause other teeth to shift and tilt, creating a bad bite and
        increasing the possibility of gum disease.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Incomplete orthodontic treatment as a teen:</strong> Many adults received some orthodontic treatment as a child or teen,
        but never completed their treatment. As an adult, they choose to complete their orthodontic treatment to achieve
        the healthy, beautiful smile they always wanted.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Our practice also recognizes that adults and children have different needs, and require a different level of
    attention and care. We will work with you to ensure that you receive the most appropriate treatments, and that your
    needs are met with understanding and respect from us.</p>

<h2>Why should you consider orthodontic treatment?</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Straight teeth are healthy teeth.</strong> Teeth that are properly aligned are easier to keep clean with flossing and
        brushing, and may help prevent other health problems.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Mouths left untreated can get worse.</strong> Not receiving orthodontic treatment when it's needed can create long-term
        health issues costing you more in the end.
    </li>
</ul>
