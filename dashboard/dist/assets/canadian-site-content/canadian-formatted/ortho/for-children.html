<p>While there is no exact age for children to begin orthodontic treatment, the Canadian Association of Orthodontists recommends visiting the orthodontist around age seven.</p>

<p>By this age, most children have a mix of baby teeth and adult teeth, making it easier for the orthodontist to diagnose and correct tooth and jaw problems sooner and without surgery.</p>

<h3>Early treatment allows your orthodontist to:</h3>

<ul>

<li>Correct and guide the growth of your child's jaw to help the permanent teeth come in straight</li>
<li>Regulate the width of the upper and lower arches</li>
<li>Create more space for crowded teeth</li>
<li>Avoid the need for permanent tooth extractions later in life</li>
<li>Correct thumb-sucking and help improve minor speech problems</li>
</ul>

<p>For parents, it's not always easy to know if your child may need orthodontic treatment.</p>

<h3>Here are a few things to look for that may mean your child needs to see an orthodontist:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Early or late loss of baby teeth</li>
<li>A hard time chewing or biting food</li>
<li>Mouth breathing</li>
<li>Finger or thumb sucking</li>
<li>Crowded, misplaced, or blocked teeth</li>
<li>Jaws that pop or make sounds when opening and closing</li>
<li>Teeth that come together abnormally, or do not come together at all</li>
<li>Jaws and teeth that are not proportionate to the rest of the face</li>
<li>Crowded front teeth around age seven or eight</li>
</ul>

<p>Please contact our practice to schedule an appointment for an orthodontic evaluation. Early treatment now will give your child a healthy, beautiful smile for the future.</p>
