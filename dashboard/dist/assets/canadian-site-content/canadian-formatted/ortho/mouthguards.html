<p>Protecting your smile while playing sports is essential when you have braces. Mouthguards help protect your teeth and gums from injury. If you participate in basketball, boxing, hockey, football, gymnastics, lacrosse, martial arts, racquetball, rugby, track and field, skateboarding, skiing and snowboarding, skydiving, soccer, surfing, volleyball, water polo, weightlifting, wrestling, it is recommended by the Canadian Association of Orthodontists that you wear a mouthguard. </p>

<h2>Types of Mouthguards</h2>

<p>Choosing the right mouthguard is essential. There are three basic types of mouthguards: the pre-made mouthguard, the "boil-and-bite" fitted mouthguard, and a custom-made mouthguard from your orthodontist. When you chose a mouthguard, be sure to pick one that is tear-resistant, comfortable and well fitted for your mouth, easy to keep clean, and does not prevent you from breathing properly.</p>


<p>Pre-made mouthguards and "boil-and-bite" mouthguards can be purchased at most sporting good stores; while custom-made mouthguards are specially designed by your orthodontist to provide optimal protection against mouth injuries. If you wear braces or a retainer, it is imperative for you to wear a mouthguard during contact sports. Your doctor can show you how to wear a mouthguard properly and how to choose the right mouthguard to protect your smile.</p>

<h2>Taking Care of Your Mouthguard</h2>

<p>Similar to a retainer, braces, or any other special dental appliance, it is important to take care of your mouthguard by storing it properly and keeping it clean, as well as knowing when to replace your old mouthguard with a new one. Here are a few simple ways to keep your mouthguard clean and working correctly:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gently scrub your mouthguard after each use with a toothbrush and toothpaste.</li>
<li>Store your mouthguard in a protective case.</li>
<li>Do not leave your mouthguard in the sun or in hot water as it may melt or become deformed.</li>
<li>Replace your mouthguard at the beginning of every new sports season. You should also replace your mouthguard if you notice it has become worn and not longer fits properly.</li>
<li>Do not wear a retainer with your mouthguard. If you wear braces, your doctor will help design a mouthguard to protect your teeth and your braces.</li>
<li>Do no chew on, or cut pieces off, your mouthguard. Mouthguards come in different shapes and sizes, so ask your doctor which is best for you.</li>
<li>Bring your mouthguard to each orthodontic checkup and your doctor can check to make sure it's still in good shape!</li>
