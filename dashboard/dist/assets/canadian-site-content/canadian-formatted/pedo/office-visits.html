<p>Our practice is committed to providing you and your family with safe, gentle, high quality dental care. We understand that your child may feel anxious about visiting the dentist. We are sensitive to children’s needs and it is our goal to make you feel comfortable visiting our practice while providing you with the best care possible.</p>
<h3>Your first visit is all about your child <i>– their comfort, happiness, and health.</i></h3>
<p>During your child’s first visit, we will review their dental and medical history forms, and take X-rays of their teeth and mouth. Then, the doctor will meet with you and your child to discuss the X-rays, help create an individual treatment plan, and answer any questions that you may have. At your child’s next visit, one of our hygienists will clean and polish their teeth, checking for any cavities or early signs of tooth decay or gingivitis.</p>
<h3>Bring your smile, but also remember to bring these with you to your child’s first appointment:</h3>
<ul><li>Your completed patient information form</li>
<li>Your insurance card</li></ul>
<h3>Regular checkups are an important part of maintaining a healthy smile!</h3>
<p>The Canadian Dental Association recommends that children visit the dentist every six months for regular checkups and routine teeth cleanings to keep their teeth and gums healthy.</p>
<p>We understand that your family has a busy schedule, so when you're preparing for a dental visit, please remember that an appointment can last between 20 to 40 minutes.</p>
