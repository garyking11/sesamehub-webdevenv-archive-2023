<h3>Dental Cleanings and Regular Checkups</h3>
<p>Regular dental checkups are an important part of maintaining good oral health. During regular checkups, the hygienist will:</p>
<ul><li>Check for any problems that may not be seen or felt</li>
<li>Look for cavities or any other signs of tooth decay</li>
<li>Inspect the teeth and gums for gingivitis and signs of periodontal disease</li>
<li>Provide a thorough teeth cleaning, rinse, and polish</li>
<p>Visiting the dentist every six months gives you and your child the chance to talk with the doctor and receive answers for any questions you may have about your family’s oral health. Checkups are also a great way to find out about new treatments that may benefit your child’s smile.</p>
<h3>Choosing the Right Toothpaste and Toothbrush</h3>
<p>From toothpaste and mouthwash to toothbrushes and dental floss, it’s important to choose the right products. Keep in mind that when you’re looking for a new toothpaste or toothbrush be sure to choose one that has been approved by the Canadian Dental Association (CDA). Your dentist can also help by recommending certain dental products for use at home. </p>
