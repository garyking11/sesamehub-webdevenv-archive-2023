<h2>
Dental Cleanings and Regular Checkups</h2>
<p>
Regular dental checkups are an important part of maintaining your oral health. During your regular checkup, your hygienist will:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Check for any problems that you may not see or feel</li>
<li>
Look for cavities or any other signs of tooth decay</li>
<li>
Inspect your teeth and gums for gingivitis and signs of periodontal disease</li>
<li>
Provide a thorough teeth cleaning, rinse, and polish</li>
</ul>
<p>
Visiting the dentist every six months gives you the chance to talk with your doctor and receive answers for any questions you may have about your oral health. Checkups are also a great way for you to find out about new treatments that may benefit your smile.</p>
<h2>
Choosing the Right Toothpaste and Toothbrush</h2>
<p>
From toothpaste and mouthwash to toothbrushes and dental floss, it&#39;s important to choose the right products for your smile. Keep in mind that when you&#39;re looking for a new toothpaste or toothbrush, be sure to choose one that has been approved by the Canadian Dental Association (CDA). Your dentist can also help by recommending certain dental products for use at home.</p>
