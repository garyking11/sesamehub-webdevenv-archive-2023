<h2>
Temporomandibular Disorder (TMD)</h2>
<p>
Millions of Canadians suffer from chronic facial and neck pain as well as recurring headaches. In some cases, this pain is due to Temporomandibular Disorder, or TMD.</p>
<p>
Your temporomandibular joints (TMJ) connect your lower jawbone to your skull. These joints get a lot of use throughout the day as you speak, chew, swallow, and yawn. Pain in and around these joints can be unpleasant and may even restrict movement.</p>
<h2>
Symptoms of TMD include:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Pain in the jaw area</li>
<li>
Pain, ringing, or stuffiness in the ears</li>
<li>
Frequent headaches or neck aches</li>
<li>
Clicking or popping sound when the jaw moves</li>
<li>
Swelling on the sides of the face</li>
<li>
Muscle spasms in the jaw area</li>
<li>
A change in the alignment of top and bottom teeth</li>
<li>
Locked jaw or limited opening of the mouth</li>
</ul>
<p>
Should you notice any of these symptoms, let your doctor know. Your dentist can identify the presence of TMD and create an effective treatment just for you.</p>
<p>
There are a few simple steps you can take at home or work to prevent TMD from becoming more severe, or to prevent it from occurring:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Relax your face &mdash; remember the rule: &quot;Lips together, teeth apart&quot;</li>
<li>
Avoid grinding your teeth</li>
<li>
Avoid constant gum chewing</li>
<li>
Don&#39;t cradle the phone receiver between your head and shoulder &mdash; either use a headset or hold the receiver in your hand</li>
<li>
Chew food evenly on both sides of your mouth</li>
<li>
Do not sit with your chin rested on your hand</li>
<li>
Practice good posture &mdash; keep your head up, back straight, and shoulders squared</li>
</ul>
