<h2>Using Fluoride to Protect your Teeth</h2>

<p>You brush your teeth twice a day, floss regularly and visit the dentist every six months, but did you know that rinsing with fluoride – a mineral that helps prevent cavities and tooth decay – also helps keep your teeth healthy and strong?</p>

<p>Fluoride is effective in preventing cavities and tooth decay by increasing your tooth enamel's natural resistance to decay.</p>

<h3>Fluoride comes in two varieties, topical and systemic:</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Topical fluoride</strong> is applied directly to the tooth, and includes toothpastes and mouth rinses.</li>

<li><strong>Systemic fluorides</strong> are generally only used by your dentist or orthodontist, and are not often available for at-home use. Systemic fluoride treatments are designed to help protect the oral health of adults and children undergoing dental procedures. Fluoride used in the orthodontist's office is often a much stronger concentration than in toothpaste or mouthwash, but is available at some drug stores or a pharmacy (ask your orthodontist before purchasing professional strength fluoride).</li>

After the treatment, you may be asked not to rinse, eat, or drink for at least 30 minutes in order to allow the teeth to absorb the fluoride. Depending on your oral health or your doctor's recommendation, you may be required to have a fluoride treatment every three, six, or 12 months. Your doctor may also prescribe an at-home fluoride product such as mouthwash, gels, or antibacterial rinses.</p>

<h2>How to choose the right fluoride treatment</h2>

<p>When choosing your own at-home fluoride product (such as toothpaste or mouthwash), always check for the Canadian Dental Association's (CDA) seal of acceptance. Products marked with the CDA seal of approval have been carefully examined by the CDA, and approved, based on safety and effectiveness. Take care of your teeth, and smile bright, with dental flu</p>
