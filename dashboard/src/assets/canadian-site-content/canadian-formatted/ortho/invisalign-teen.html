<h2>We are a Certified Invisalign Teen Provider</h2>

<strong>Bummed out about having braces?</strong>
<p>Invisalign Teen aligners give you a whole new way to wear braces for a “clearly” amazing smile!</p>

<strong>I have enough to worry about...</strong>
<p>...now I need braces too?</p>
<p>The team has a game this Friday night, homecoming is in a month, and what about my yearbook pictures?! Don't stress;
    during your Invisalign Teen treatment you won't need to turn down any dates, wear a paper bag over your head, or
    hide out in your room for two years! Invisalign Teen aligners are a perfect fit for your lifestyle, because aligners
    are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Clear</li>
    <li>Removable</li>
    <li>Super comfortable</li>
    <li>Customized just for you</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pizza, Popcorn ... No Problem!</h2>

<p>You've probably heard from friends that with braces you won't be able to eat anything. With Invisalign Teen aligners,
    you can eat whatever you want!</p>

<p>Unlike traditional metal braces, your Invisalign Teen aligners are removable, which means you can go ahead and eat
    all the things you love without worrying about breaking a bracket or losing a rubber band. Cheers!</p>

<h2>It's your life; keep it that way!</h2>
<p>Invisalign Teen aligners fit in with all of your extracurricular activities. So whether you're swimming the 50-meter
    race, throwing the football out on the field, or playing the clarinet with the school band, you don't have to worry
    about your braces getting in the way!</p>
