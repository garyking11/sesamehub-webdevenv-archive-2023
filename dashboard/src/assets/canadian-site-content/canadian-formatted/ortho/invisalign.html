<h2>We are a Certified Invisalign Provider</h2>

<p>Consider Invisalign treatment to straighten your teeth without braces. A complimentary consultation with our doctor
    can determine if Invisalign clear aligners are right for you.</p>

<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>Invisalign treatment uses a series of virtually invisible, removable, and comfortable aligners that allow you to
    smile more during treatment as well as after. Invisalign clear aligners are made with 3D computer imaging technology
    and have been proven effective.</p>

<h2>Why would I want it?</h2>
<p>Not only are the aligners virtually invisible, they are removable, so you can eat and drink what you want while in
    treatment. Plus, brushing and flossing are no problem. They are also more comfortable than traditional braces, with
    no metal or wires, which also usually means you spend less time in your doctor's office getting adjustments.
    Invisalign treatment also allows you to view your own virtual treatment plan when you start so you can see how your
    straight teeth will look when your treatment is complete.</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>You wear each set of aligners for about two weeks, removing them only to eat, drink, brush, and floss. As you replace
    each aligner with the next in the series, your teeth will move — little by little, week by week — until they have
    straightened to their final positions. You'll visit us about once every six weeks to ensure that your treatment is
    progressing as planned. Total treatment time averages nine to 15 months and the average number of aligners worn
    during treatment is between 18 and 30, but both will vary from case to case.</p>
