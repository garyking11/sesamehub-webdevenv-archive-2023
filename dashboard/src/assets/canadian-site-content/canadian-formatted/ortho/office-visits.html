<p>Our greatest goal is to give you a healthy, straight, beautiful smile. We understand that choosing to receive
    orthodontic care is a big decision, and we respect your reasons for wanting to improve the way you look and feel.
    Our practice will work with you every step of the way to make sure that your orthodontic care is as rewarding as
    possible.</p>

<h2>Every smile starts with an initial consultation!</h2>
<p>Your initial consultation will give you the opportunity to meet our team, learn more about orthodontics, receive a
    complete initial exam, and find out which treatment options will best meet your needs. During your initial
    consultation, we will:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Review your dental and medical history forms</li>
    <li>Provide a complete oral exam, with X-rays, to determine if treatment is necessary</li>
    <li>Help you create a customized treatment plan</li>
    <li>Discuss all financial information, insurance options, and payment plans</li>
</ul>

<p>Our team will be glad to answer any questions you may have, and we will provide all of the information that you need
    to determine which treatment is right for you. Please contact our practice to schedule your initial
    consultation.</p>

<h2>What happens after the initial consultation?</h2>

<p>You're one step closer to achieving the smile you've always wanted! After your consultation, we will schedule your
    first appointment and your doctor will place your new orthodontic appliance. This appointment generally takes about
    an hour, and during this time, our team will be available to make sure that you are as comfortable as possible.</p>

<h2>Scheduling Appointments</h2>
<p>Visiting the orthodontist about every four to eight weeks is an important part of your orthodontic treatment. Our
    practice will work with you to make sure that your appointments are as convenient as possible. When scheduling
    appointments, please let us know what days and times work best for you.</p>

<p>We understand that “life happens”! If you're running late or need to reschedule, please let us know and we will do
    everything we can to accommodate you. When you're ready to schedule your first appointment, contact our practice and
    our friendly scheduling coordinator will assist you. We look forward to working with you.
</p>

<h2>Visiting the Dentist during Orthodontic Treatment</h2>
<p>It is very important that you continue to visit your family dentist once every six months, even during your
    orthodontic treatment, for teeth cleanings and routine dental checkups. If extra dental care is necessary, we will
    be happy to coordinate with your family dentist to make sure that you receive the care you need.</p>
