<p>Your child brushes her teeth twice a day, flosses regularly and visits the dentist every six months, but did you know that rinsing with fluoride – a mineral that helps prevent cavities and tooth decay – also helps keep her teeth healthy and strong?</p><p>Fluoride is effective in preventing cavities and tooth decay by coating teeth and preventing plaque from building-up and hardening on the tooth’s surface.</p>
<h4>Fluoride comes in two varieties, systemic and topical:</h4>
<ul><li><b>Systemic fluoride</b> is ingested, usually through a public water supply. While teeth are forming under the gums, the fluoride strengthens tooth enamel, making it stronger and more resistant to cavities.</li>
<li>Fluoride can also be applied <b>topically</b> to help prevent caries (cavities) on teeth present in the mouth. It is delivered through toothpaste, mouthwash, and professional fluoride applications. Professional application of topical fluoride foam and varnishes are also a valuable tool in cavity prevention.</li></ul>
<h4>Receiving a fluoride treatment from your dentist</h4>
<p>A fluoride treatment in the dentist’s office takes just a few minutes. After the treatment, patients may be asked not to rinse, eat, or drink for at least 30 minutes in order to allow the teeth to absorb the fluoride. Depending on your child’s oral health or your doctor’s recommendation, your child may be required to have a fluoride treatment every three, six, or 12 months. The doctor may also prescribe an at-home fluoride product such as mouthwash, gels, or antibacterial rinses.</p>
<h4>How to choose the right fluoride treatment</h4>
<p>When choosing your own at-home fluoride product (such as toothpaste or mouthwash), always check for the Canadian Dental Association’s (CDA) seal of acceptance. Products marked with the CDA seal of approval have been carefully examined by the CDA, and approved, based on safety and effectiveness. Take care of your child’s teeth so they can smile bright with dental fluoride treatments!</p>
