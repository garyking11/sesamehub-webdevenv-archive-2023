<p>Protecting your child's smile while playing sports is essential. Sports related injuries to the mouth and jaw are some of the most common injuries received by athletes.</p>
<p>Mouthguards help protect teeth and gums from injury. If your child participates in basketball, boxing, hockey, football, gymnastics, lacrosse, martial arts, racquetball, rugby, track and field, skateboarding, skiing and snowboarding, skydiving, soccer, surfing, volleyball, water polo, weightlifting or wrestling, it is recommended by the Canadian Dental Association that a mouthguard is worn.</p>
<h3>Types of mouthguards</h3>
<p>Choosing the right mouthguard is essential. There are three basic types of mouthguards: the pre-made mouthguard, the "boil-and-bite" fitted mouthguard, and a custom-made mouthguard from your dentist. When choosing a mouthguard, be sure to pick one that is tear-resistant, comfortable and well fitted for your child’s mouth, easy to keep clean, and does not prevent him from breathing properly. If he wears braces or a retainer, it is imperative for him to wear a mouthguard. Your dentist can show your child how to wear a mouthguard properly and how to choose the right mouthguard to protect his smile.</p>
<h3>Taking care of your child’s mouthguard</h3>
<p>Similar to a retainer, braces, or any other special dental appliance, it is important to take care of your child’s mouthguard by storing it properly and keeping it clean, as well as  knowing when to replace an old mouthguard with a new one. Here are a few simple ways to keep your child’s mouthguard clean and working correctly:</p>
<ul><li>Gently scrub the mouthguard after each use with a toothbrush and toothpaste.</li>
<li>Store the mouthguard in a protective case.</li>
<li>Do not leave the mouthguard in the sun or in hot water, as it may melt or become deformed.</li>
<li>Replace the mouthguard at the beginning of every new sports season. You should also replace your child’s mouthguard if you notice it has become worn and not longer fits properly.</li>
<li>Do not wear a retainer with a mouthguard. If your child wears braces, your dentist will help design a mouthguard to protect his teeth and his braces.</li>
<li>Do no chew on or cut pieces off of your mouthguard. Mouthguards come in different shapes and sizes, so ask your dentist which is best for your child.</li>
<li>Bring the mouthguard to each dental checkup and the dentist can check to make sure it’s still in good shape!</li></ul>
<p>Our goal is to help minimize your child's chances of a sports related injury to his smile. Be sure to ask your dentist about mouthguards at your child's next dental checkup.</p>
